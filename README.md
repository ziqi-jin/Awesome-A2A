[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome resources about Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol - a new standard for AI agent communication.

## What is A2A?

Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is a new communication standard introduced by Google that enables AI agents to interact with each other in a structured and efficient way. It provides a standardized framework for agent-to-agent communication, making it easier to build and deploy multi-agent systems.

### Key Features
- **Standardized Communication**: Provides a common language for AI agents to communicate
- **Interoperability**: Enables different AI systems to work together seamlessly
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle complex multi-agent interactions
- **Security**: Built-in security measures for agent-to-agent communication
- **Extensibility**: Flexible protocol that can be extended for specific use cases

## Core Concepts

### Protocol Components
- **Message Format**: Standardized message structure for agent communication
- **State Management**: How agents maintain and share state
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error reporting and recovery
- **Authentication**: Security measures for agent identification
- **Message Routing**: How messages are directed between agents

### Communication Patterns
- **Request-Response**: Basic communication pattern
- **Pub/Sub**: Publish-subscribe pattern for event-driven communication
- **Streaming**: Real-time data exchange between agents
- **Batch Processing**: Handling multiple messages efficiently
