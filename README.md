# Awesome Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
> A curated list of awesome resources about Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol - a new standard for AI agent communication.
## What is A2A?
Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is a new communication standard introduced by Google that enables AI agents to interact with each other in a structured and efficient way. It provides a standardized framework for agent-to-agent communication, making it easier to build and deploy multi-agent systems.
### Key Features
- **Standardized Communication**: Provides a common language for AI agents to communicate
- **Interoperability**: Enables different AI systems to work together seamlessly
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle complex multi-agent interactions
- **Security**: Built-in security measures for agent-to-agent communication
- **Extensibility**: Flexible protocol that can be extended for specific use cases
